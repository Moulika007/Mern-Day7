        <h2>chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="chpone">Rama Natha was the son of a rich landlord.His father left him large tracts of land when he
            died. But Rama Natha did not spend even one
day looking after his land. This was because
he had a funny idea—he believed there was
a magic potion that could turn any object
into gold. He spent all his time to learn more
about this potion. People cheated him often,
promising to tell him about it, but he did not
give up. His wife, Madhumati, was tired of this
and also worried because she saw how much
money Rama Natha was spending. She was
sure that soon they would be without money</p>

<h2>chapter 2</h2>
<p class="chptwo">Are that soon they would be without money.
One day, a famous sage called Mahipati
came to their town. Rama Natha became his
follower and asked him about the potion. To his
surprise the sage answered, “Yes, in my travels
in the Himalayas, I heard how you could make
such a potion. But it is difficult.”
“Tell me!” requested Rama Natha, not
believing his luck.</p>

<h2>chapter 3</h2>
<p class="chpthree">“You have to plant a banana plant and
water it regularly with your hands. In winter,
the morning dew is on the leaves. You have to
collect the dew and store it in a bottle. When
you have five litres of dew, bring it to me. I will
chant some magic words, which will turn it
into the magic potion. A drop of the potion will
change any object into gold.</p>
